# chef-auto-patch [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bflad/chef-auto-patch.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/bflad/chef-auto-patch)

## Description

Chef Cookbook for automatically patching nodes on a specific schedule (weekday,
hour, and minute). Handles weekly or monthly patching routines with or without
node splay for large environments. Can automatically prepare node for true patch
window by cleaning and pre-downloading packages, which speeds up patch process
and can help guarantee meeting patching timeframes.

If you're looking for daily upgrades on Ubuntu, check out the
[unattended-upgrades package](https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/automatic-updates.html)
and a [corresponding cookbook](https://github.com/firstbanco/chef-unattended-upgrades).
(/ht [@hectcastro](https://github.com/hectcastro) for this information).

## Requirements

### Platforms

* RedHat 6.3 (Santiago)
* Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise)

### Cookbooks

* cron

## Attributes

* `node["auto-patch"]["disable"]` - defaults to false
* `node["auto-patch"]["hour"]` - defaults to 3
* `node["auto-patch"]["minute"]` - defaults to 0
* `node["auto-patch"]["monthly"]` - auto patching occurs once a month on the
  corresponding textual week number ("first","second",etc) and weekday
  ("monday","tuesday",etc), overridden by `node["auto-patch"]["weekly"]`,
  defaults to "first sunday"
* `node["auto-patch"]["reboot"]` - reboot automatically after patching, defaults
  to true
* `node["auto-patch"]["splay"]` - seconds of random delay before beginning,
  defaults to 0
* `node["auto-patch"]["weekly"]` - auto patching occurs once a week on the
  corresponding textual weekday ("monday","tuesday",etc), overrides
  `node["auto-patch"]["monthly"]`, defaults to nil

### Patch Preparation

* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["clean"]` - cleans updater cache files, defaults
  to true
* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["disable"]` - defaults to true
* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["hour"]` - defaults to 2
* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["minute"]` - defaults to 0
* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["monthly"]` - auto patching prep occurs once a
  month on the corresponding textual week number ("first","second",etc) and
  weekday ("monday","tuesday",etc), overridden by
  `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["weekly"]`, defaults to "first sunday"
* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["splay"]` - seconds of random delay before
  beginning, defaults to 1800
* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["weekly"]` - auto patching prep occurs once a week
  on the corresponding textual weekday ("monday","tuesday",etc), overrides
  `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["monthly"]`, defaults to nil
* `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["update_updater"]` - updates apt or yum before
  actual patching occurs, defaults to true

## Recipes

* `recipe[auto-patch]` configures automatic patching

## Usage

* Change any attributes to fit your patching cycle
* If using auto patch preparation, ensure it starts before auto patch (remember
  any splay!)
* Add `recipe[auto-patch]` to your node's run list

### Weekly automatic patching

Just use the `node["auto-patch"]["weekly"]` attribute to override the monthly
setting. Don't forget to add appropriate `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["weekly"]`
if you're using automatic patch preparation.

### Automatic patching of large numbers of nodes

If you're auto patching many nodes at once, you have two attributes you can
optionally add to prevent denial of service against your network, update
server(s), and resources:
* Adding `node["auto-patch"]["splay"]`
* Setting `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["disable"]` to false (along with setting
  associated prep attributes to meet your patch cycle)

### Using roles to specify auto patching groups

If you'd like to specify groups of nodes for auto patching, you can setup roles.

Say you want to auto patch some nodes at 8am and some at 10pm on your monthly
"patch day" of the fourth Wednesday every month.

If you have a base role (you do, right?), you can save duplicating attributes
and specify some base information first:

    "auto-patch" => {
      "monthly" => "fourth wednesday",
      "prep" => {
        "disable" => false,
        "hour" => 7,
        "monthly" => "fourth wednesday"
      }
    }

Example role that then could be added to 8am nodes:

    name "auto-patch-0800"
    description "Role for automatically patching nodes at 8am on patch day."
    default_attributes(
      "auto-patch" => {
        "hour" => 8
      }
    )
    run_list(
      "recipe[auto-patch]"
    )

Example role that then could be added to 10pm nodes:

    name "auto-patch-2200"
    description "Role for automatically patching nodes at 10pm on patch day."
    default_attributes(
      "auto-patch" => {
        "hour" => 22
      }
    )
    run_list(
      "recipe[auto-patch]"
    )

### Disabling automatic patching

* Specify `node["auto-patch"]["disable"]` to true
* If necessary, specify `node["auto-patch"]["prep"]["disable"]` to true
* Run chef-client on your node
