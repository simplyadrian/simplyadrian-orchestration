# ephemeral_lvm cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rightscale-cookbooks/ephemeral_lvm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rightscale-cookbooks/ephemeral_lvm)

This cookbook will identify the ephemeral devices available on the instance based on Ohai data. If no ephemeral devices
are found, it will gracefully exit with a log message. If ephemeral devices are found, they will be setup to
use LVM and a logical volume will be created, formatted, and mounted. If multiple ephemeral devices are found
(e.g. m1.large on EC2 has 2 ephemeral devices with 420 GB each), they will be striped to create the LVM.

# Requirements

* Chef 11 or higher
* A cloud that supports ephemeral devices. Currently supported clouds: EC2, Openstack, and Google.
* Cookbook requirements
  * [lvm](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/lvm)
* Platforms
  * Ubuntu 12.04
  * CentOS 6

# Usage

Place the `ephemeral_lvm::default` in the runlist and the ephemeral devices will be setup.

# Attributes

* `node['ephemeral_lvm']['filesystem']` - the filesystem to be used on the ephemeral volume. Default: `'ext4'`
* `node['ephemeral_lvm']['mount_point']` - the mount point for the ephemeral volume. Default: `'/mnt/ephemeral'`
* `node['ephemeral_lvm']['volume_group_name']` - the volume group name for the ephemeral LVM. Default: `'vg-data'`
* `node['ephemeral_lvm']['logical_volume_size']` - the size to be used for the ephemeral LVM. Default: `'100%VG'` - This will use all available space in the volume group.
* `node['ephemeral_lvm']['logical_volume_name']` - the name of the logical volume for ephemeral LVM. Default: `'ephemeral0'`
* `node['ephemeral_lvm']['stripe_size']` - the stripe size to be used for the ephemeral logical volume. Default: `512`

# Recipes
